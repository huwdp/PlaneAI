# PlaneAI
PlaneAI is a learning project used for recognizing fighter jet aircraft using an artificial intelligence. 

The project will use the resources listed below to build the system.
* https://towardsdatascience.com/train-image-recognition-ai-with-5-lines-of-code-8ed0bdd8d9ba
* https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/10/keras-tutorial-how-to-get-started-with-keras-deep-learning-and-python/

The models are placed within the train directory and then the aircraft name, so ./train/F-22/etc. Models will not be included due to _legal reasons_.
